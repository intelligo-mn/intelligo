wordsworth
=========

Spell-checker / spelling correcter module for Nodejs based off of Peter Norvig's
spelling corrector publication (http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and John Resig's
instructions on string-based binary searching (http://ejohn.org/blog/revised-javascript-dictionary-search/).

Installation
=========
     npm install wordsworth

Use
=========

Asynchronous Initialization
---------

The sample `/data/en_US/seed.txt` and `/data/en_US/training.txt` files are fairly large and as such have
been compressed and provided in an archive located in `/data/`.  To run the examples, extract
the contents of the archive into `/en_US`.

    var sp = require('wordsworth').getInstance();

    sp.initialize(

      '../data/en_US/seed.txt',
      '../data/en_US/training.txt', function() {

        console.log('Initialized!');

        // indicates whether or not the spell-checker knows the given word
        console.log(sp.exists('hello'));
        console.log(sp.exists('polymorphism'));

        /**
         * Accepts a single word and will return an ordered Array, most probable to
         * least probable, of suggested spelling corrections IF the given word has been
         * mis-spelled.
         */
        console.log(sp.suggest('polymrphism'));

        /**
         * Will return an Object containing keys representing any misspelled
         * words in the provided text along with an ordered Array of potential
         * spelling corrections for each key.
         */
        console.log(sp.analyze('This sentense will havv a fiw speling errorrs.'));

      }
    );

Synchronous Initialization
---------

    var sp = require('wordsworth').getInstance();

    var seeds = ['one', 'two', 'three']; // language dictionary, one word per array index
    var training = [
        'large amounts of training text',
        'ideally one sentence per array index'
    ];

    sp.initializeSync(seeds, training);
    sp.exists('one');
    sp.suggest('some mis-spelled word');
